    <div style="font-size: 24px">
        We planned to implement a system that allowed users to keep track of courses they've completed on various educational sites like Lynda, Khan Academy, or Udemy, all in one place.
        Originally, we were going to implement a point reward system that was linked to user accounts that awarded them based on the difficulty and length of the completed
        course.
